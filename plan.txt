Assumptions:
    Wind is uniform across environment (but varies each frame within range of prevailing wind)
    All angle measurements are in radians in range [-pi, pi] unless reported (which will be degrees)
    true_sailboat is only visible to environment
    Environment assigns an id for a boat and keeps track of its real-world position

    Wind direction determines which way the wind blows (down along that direction), NOT from which direction it blows. For
    example, wind direction 0 means the wind blows from the origin, to the right.

    Todo's are listed in code

    Rudder angle:
        When boat goes straight, the rudder is at position 0.
        When boat turns full left (turns counter-clockwise), the rudder is at pi/2
        When boat turns full right (turns clockwise), the rudder is at -pi/2

Jonathan: I will flush out the rest of the initial environment.
