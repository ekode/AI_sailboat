Assumptions:
    Wind is uniform across environment (but varies each frame within range of prevailing wind)
    All angle measurements are in radians in range [-pi, pi] unless reported (which will be degrees)
    true_sailboat is only visible to environment
    Environment assigns an id for a boat and keeps track of its real-world position

    Todo's are listed in code

Jonathan: I will flush out the rest of the initial environment.
